# Late Tweet

Example of websocket application that streams the messages on a particular delay.

In this code, every tweet will be broadcast on 10 seconds delay.

Main library that I use in this project
- compression
  To compress every response.
- socket.io
  To handle the websocket.
- node-schedule
  To handle the delay.

Highlight
- ES6
- Code styling with standard JS
- Simple client application
- Highly testable code
